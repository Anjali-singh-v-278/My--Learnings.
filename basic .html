Hi, I'm Anjali Singh V, a BCA student with a passion for building meaningful digital experiences that help people grow — starting with themselves.<BR><BR>


I love creating with Notion and Canva, using them not just as productivity tools but as platforms to design systems that enhance clarity, discipline, and creative flow.<BR><BR>

My current focus:
• Building simple, impactful self-growth tools
• Sharing what I learn — from tech to personal growth<BR><BR>

Whether it's coding an interface, designing a Notion workspace, or launching a micro-product that sparks change, I enjoy the process of building things that matter.<BR>
